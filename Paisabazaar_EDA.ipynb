These derived metrics capture customer financial stress and suggest repayment behavior.\n",

        "1. Predictive Risk-Based Scoring:\n",
        "Utilize the engineered features—annual income, credit utilization ratio, delay ratio, outstanding debt, number of credit inquiries, and composite risk score—within machine learning models to automate credit risk classification. This will allow Paisabazaar to rapidly and accurately assess applicants, leading to faster, more objective loan decisioning and reduced manual intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Data-Driven Customer Segmentation:\n",
        "Apply clustering and grouping methods on financial and behavioral variables (e.g., loan and credit card usage, payment history, delay ratios) to identify distinct customer profiles. Use these segments to design targeted product offerings, replicate successful customer journeys.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Continuous Risk Monitoring and Early Intervention:\n",
        "Integrate real-time risk flags and utilization/debt monitoring into loan servicing workflows. When risk indicators (like spikes in utilization or frequent delayed payments) are detected, trigger timely outreach, proactive credit limit management, or tailored repayment options, preventing defaults and preserving portfolio quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Personalized Financial Solutions and Communication:\n",
        "Leverage the insights from risk scoring and segmentation to make personalized product recommendations for each customer—such as offering consolidation loans to high-debt users, specialized cards to disciplined spenders, or insurance add-ons for users with volatile income. Complement this with clear, data-driven advice to build trust and empower customers to improve their credit health.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Enable Data Transparency and Awareness:\n",
        "Share summary risk profiles and actionable credit tips with customers to enhance engagement and loyalty. Internally, deploy visual dashboards tracking portfolio risk shifts, top risk drivers, and product uptake, ensuring management can steer strategy with agility."

        "After performing the required steps we can see that the customer data analysis underscores the importance of both financial and behavioral factors in assessing credit risk at Paisabazaar. Income, repayment patterns, loan exposure, and credit utilization emerged as the principal drivers of creditworthiness. Notably, while middle-income and working-age customers constitute the majority, repayment discipline and debt management, rather than earnings alone, serve as the clearest predictors of strong credit scores.\n",

        "From visual explorations it is confirmed that customers prone to delayed payments or high utilization present elevated risk, supporting the need for robust risk monitoring and targeted policies for these segments. Conversely, customers with healthy financial ratios and reliable payment histories represent attractive prospects for premium products and cross-sell opportunities.\n",
